## Data Driven Businesses with SQL & Tableau

In this project data analysis with the help of SQL is performed on a given data set. 
 ``` 
      SELECT *
      FROM magist; 
 ```
      
*The Eniac company is considering expansion to the Brazilian market and after careful analysis we are trying to decide whether or not the Magist platform is a good choice for future business collaboration.* 
> Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories and Magist is a Brazilian service company that acts as a mediator for sales.

There were ***two main concerns regarding Magist:***
1. Are the marketplaces Magist works with a good place for the high-end tech products that Eniac sells?
2. How satisfactory are the delivery services that Magist offers?
